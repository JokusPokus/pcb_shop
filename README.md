# PCB Online Shop

### Semester Project CODE University Spring 2021

The complete documentation with background information, 
instructions for setting up a development environment, 
and the required material for the SE_05 module can be found 
in the [repository Wiki](https://github.com/JokusPokus/pcb_shop/wiki).

Please note that after the submission deadline (May 3), I will 
keep working on the develop branch. The master branch will remain 
untouched.
